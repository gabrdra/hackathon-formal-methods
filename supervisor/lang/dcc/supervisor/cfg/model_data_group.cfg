# Model Data Group
#
# This configuration file sort implementations in 3 groups :
#   - constants
#   - no_checked_data
#   - safety_data

# Implementations containing constants definitions
# Note : machine containing SETS have to be in the constant clause too
%constants g_types_i user_configuration_i user_ctx_i

# Implementations containing data which don't have to be checked.
# Their values can be different in each replicas
%no_checked_data

# Implementations containing data that have to be checked.
# Their values must be the same in each replicas
